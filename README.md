# EvacuationOptimization
The edge application was based on YOLOv5. Please download the YOLOv5 project on your Jetson Nano or other edge computing devices. 
Put the 'two .py' file from EdgeProject into the YOLOv5 repository. Run 'main.py', then you are able to detect human density and smoke concentration while communicating with the central computer for real-time evacuation route optimization.
Please start your edge app before you run your route evacuation optimization app on your central computer.
